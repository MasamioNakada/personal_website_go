Hello, I’m **Masami Nakada**, a Software Developer based in Lima. I currently work as a Mid Data Engineer at Icasa, specializing in the consumer goods sector.  

My experience spans projects in Data Engineering, Backend Development, and Scripting.  

As part of my professional development, I am pursuing a degree in Data Science at the Continental University of Florida, where I have gained skills in data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning.  

I am passionate about teaching programming, so if you have any questions about programming logic (Python), feel free to reach out to me.  
At the moment, I’m exploring new technologies like Go and Rust.
